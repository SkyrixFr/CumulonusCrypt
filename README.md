# CumulonusCrypt
It's a encryption software coded in python that can be used at any time in your projects so its completely secured.
Go in to the release file to have the .exe file only for windows otherwise use the .py python file to start it on linux or on mac.

Wait a bit so it starts then put the origin file (new.txt), put in the output's name (be careful put a name not used by an another file ex : new.txt.crypt or newcrypt.txt)

Finally put in the key : be careful when you encrypt your file you can't go back if you don't have the correct key.
